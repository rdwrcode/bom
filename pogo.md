# Pogo programmer 

It is a pain to solder the SWD socket on each Snowflake. It becomes useless after flashing the code.

So to debug the code, use the prototype with the SWD header.
For release, no header, just use this pogo programmer to flash the code.
Or just use through-hole header as a cheap replacement with the pogo connector or pogo pins.
